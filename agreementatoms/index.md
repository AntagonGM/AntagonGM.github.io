# Atoms of Agreement

#### A self-actualization game by Antagon

## Theory
This is a game about consenting agreements.

In human interactions, any interaction between two parties is made up of one or more simple actions.  E.g. buying a pack of gum is made up of two actions: the buyer transmits cash to the seller, the seller transmits gum to the buyer.  A kiss might be a single simple action, a date might be many.

Each of these simple atomic actions has 3 components:  The initiator (the person proposing the action), the actor (the person who performs the action), and the beneficiary (the person who primarily benefits the most from the action).

By toggling which partner in a pair does each of the 3 roles, an atomic action can be categorized into 8 different basic types.  The goal of this game is to help you experience all 8 basic types and become comfortable with them.

# Basic Gameplay:

To play a card, first find a partner (Playing a card always requires a partner). When playing a card, “You” are always the “initiator” and must read the relevant script.  "They" refers to your partner.

Make a request of your partner like the one on the card.  You may use the included quotes as a guideline about what to say.  Try to be honest.

Remember, your partner may always say no with no consequences, and thank them for playing if they do.

# Games 

**War (2+ players)**: take turns drawing a card at random from the stack.  When you draw the card, choose another player to be your partner.  (If playing with 2 players, this is always the same).  Play the card as chosen.  ***Recommended game mode for 2 players, or monogamous people.**

**Spin the bottle (3-13 players)**: All players choose a card value A-13.  Remove any unused values from the deck and set them aside.    Take turns drawing a card at random from the stack.  On your turn, your partner is the player whose number you drew.  Play the card with your partner.  Cards may be returned to the deck to be drawn again, but we recommend instead discarding them to increase the odds everyone gets to play.  

**Team spin the bottle (4-26 players)**:  Split into 2 teams. Within each team, each player chooses a card value. (So there will be an ‘A’ player from both teams, a ‘3’ player from both teams, etc).    Play spin the bottle as above. When you draw a card, your partner is chosen as the number you drew, but you may choose from the opposite team or the same team.

**Mixer (4-13 players)**:  Each player selects a card value A-13.  Remove all unused cards from the deck and set them aside.  Give each player their own 4 cards.   To play a card, they must find a partner willing to play with them, and play the game with them, giving the card away after it is played.  The game ends when no player has any of their own cards.

**Inverse Mixer (4-13 players)**: Each player selects a card value A-13.   Remove all unused cards from the deck and set them aside.  Deal out all the cards randomly to all players.  Players should not have any of their own cards to start, and can trade if that happens.   Then, play proceeds as in mixer.  However, the goal now is to get all your own cards *back*.  In order to get a card back, they have to find their cards first, and then petition the owner.  The owner of their card shows it to them, and the petitioner must play the card with the owner in order to get it back.  The game ends when everyone has their cards back.  ***Recommended game mode for groups***.

***Mixer Variants***; any of the following variations can be added to either mixer above.
* **Race**: Instead of ending when everyone has completed the goal, it ends when one person has, and they are the winner.
* **Wall-Street**: Anyone may trade one card for one card at any time, provided that neither card is owned by the trade participants.
* **Dangerous**: A card cannot be given away until negotiations are successful
* **Bazaar**: Cards may be exchanged for tokens (chips/pennies) at any time.

**Deathmatch: (dangerous)** In a deathmatch, there are exactly 2 players.  Each player initiates one card to the other.  After both have played, If a deal was made on both plays, or on neither, then that is considered a tie.  However, if one initiator can make a deal and the other could not, then the initiator wins the match.

* ***Variant: Gladiator***: During the deathmatch, nominate one or more referees.  This might be observers, all other players, or special persons.    After a match is over, the winner is not decided by who made the deal, but by vote from the referees.


**Deathmatch Tournament (4+ players): (dangerous)** Make a tournament bracket: In each round, randomly pair up all the players who are still in for each round.  Go through all the pairs in the round and play the deathmatch.  The winner of each deathmatch advances to the next round.

**Deathmatch Bear Pit (4+ players): (dangerous)** Players make a circle.  Two players are in the middle.    Players deathmatch.   The winner stays, the loser swaps with a random person.      

**Presidential Campaign (4+ players. ) (dangerous)**  Nominate a few players to be candidates.  All other players are voters.   Cards that say “For Them” are divided evenly among the candidates.  Cards that say “For You” are divided evenly among the voters (it is normal that candidates will have more cards than voters).    Voters initiate with candidates in turn, and candidates initiate with voters as well.  After a card is played, if the voter consents, a candidate may put the played card into a bag or envelope or pile representing a vote. The candidate with the most votes wins.
